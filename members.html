                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The Members Club</h2>
                <p style="color: var(--graphite); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Members Club positioning leans into the exclusive, time-honored tradition of our annual ski gatherings. This approach channels the legacy of distinguished alpine clubs and private ski societies, evoking the storied history of European mountain lodges and members-only resorts that have defined alpine culture for generations.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--graphite); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">"Members Club" carries an inherent sense of belonging and privilege—not in an exclusionary sense, but in the warmth of shared tradition and earned camaraderie. It speaks to the bonds forged through our professional past and strengthened on mountain slopes each year. This is the nomenclature of establishments that have stood the test of time, where membership represents not just access, but kinship.</p>
                <p style="color: var(--graphite); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This positioning emphasizes the enduring nature of our friendships and the ritualistic aspect of our annual tradition. It suggests refinement, legacy, and the kind of sophisticated leisure that comes from deep professional success and cultivated taste. The Members Club framing adds gravitas and permanence—this is not a fleeting gathering, but an institution unto itself.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: var(--space); margin-top: 2rem;">It's not just a group of people or a collective. It's a way of life. It's a club, it's exclusive. It's a philosophy.</p>

                        <p>His leadership style combines the precision of someone who actually enjoys creating spreadsheets with an unwavering commitment to the pursuit of perfectly prepared venison. On the mountain, he approaches skiing with the same analytical rigor applied to everything else, favoring routes that maximize enjoyment while optimizing for risk-adjusted returns. He has been known to calculate the Sharpe ratio of various descent options before committing to a line.</p>
                        <p>Allegedly retired two years ago and appears to have been spending most of his free time on the slopes and the tennis court.</p>

                    <div class="member-bio">
                        <p>Bryan's vision for TeamExtreme emerged from a simple but profound realization: that the finest things in life (the finest cuts of wild game, luxury accommodations, and the pretense of billionaire leisure) should not be occasional indulgences but annual obligations.</p>
                        <p>As co-architect of this distinguished institution, Bryan maintains an unshakeable belief that true alpine sophistication requires both technical skiing ability and the capacity to discuss cheese with appropriate gravitas. A devoted Shibumi disciple, he approaches the mountain with refined minimalism, which manifests in his principled refusal to use safety equipment.</p>
                        <p>Bryan's leadership style reflects his deep commitment to logic and the alignment of incentives. While governance matters greatly to him, he exercises influence quietly, speaking only after all others have been heard. This patient approach is balanced by his more conspicuous passion for fine colognes and his well-documented habit of acquiring aromatic candles at every destination, a practice The Committee has diplomatically described as "comprehensive olfactory curation."</p>

Her approach to alpine adventure emphasizes the finer things: Fusalp's latest collections appear in her wardrobe with remarkable frequency, her handbag collection could warrant its own insurance policy, and her enthusiasm for raclette borders on the scholarly. </p>
                        <p>While other members obsess over vertical feet and powder conditions, Elsie maintains detailed notes on every boutique, restaurant, and raclette establishment within a 50-mile radius of our destinations. Her dinner reservations are secured with the tactical precision of a military operation, and her ability to identify the season's must-have accessories from across a crowded lodge is nothing short of remarkable.</p>
