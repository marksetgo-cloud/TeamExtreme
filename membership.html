                <h2>A Word About Exclusivity</h2>
                <p class="lead">TeamExtreme isn't just a ski trip. It's an institution. A fellowship. An annual gathering that demands the dedication of a professional athlete, the organizational skills of a Fortune 500 executive, and the willingness to spend an unreasonable amount of time debating the proper preparation of venison.</p>
                <p>Our membership roster is capped at a precise number that we've determined through rigorous analysis to be "however many people we currently have." This number has remained constant since our founding, which we believe demonstrates our unwavering commitment to maintaining standards.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 2rem; color: var(--space);">It's not just a group of people or a collective. It's a way of life. It's a club, it's exclusive. It's a philosophy.</p>

            <h2>Membership Requirements</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Prospective members must meet the following non-negotiable criteria:</p>
            
            <div class="requirements-grid">
                <div class="requirement-card">
                    <div class="requirement-number">01</div>
                    <h3>Alpine Proficiency</h3>
                    <p>Candidates must demonstrate the ability to ski down a mountain without causing significant alarm to other members. Previous experience is recommended but not required. Enthusiasm can sometimes compensate for skill, though we have yet to observe this in practice.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="requirement-card">
                    <div class="requirement-number">02</div>
                    <h3>Commitment to Excellence</h3>
                    <p>Members are required to respond to group emails within 48 hours, maintain appropriate physical conditioning for high-altitude pursuits, and demonstrate genuine interest in topics such as 'which mountain restaurant deserves its Michelin star' and 'whether après-ski begins at 3pm or 4pm'.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="requirement-card">
                    <div class="requirement-number">03</div>
                    <h3>Financial Stability</h3>
                    <p>TeamExtreme operates on what we call a "premium budget-conscious luxury" model. Members should be comfortable with expenditures that seem reasonable until you total them up, at which point they seem less reasonable but you're already committed.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="requirement-card">
                    <div class="requirement-number">04</div>
                    <h3>Sense of Humor</h3>
                    <p>Perhaps our most critical requirement. Prospective members must appreciate self-aware absurdity, understand deadpan delivery, and be comfortable with the fact that we've created an entire website with org charts and corporate titles for what is essentially a friends' ski trip.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="requirement-card">
                    <div class="requirement-number">05</div>
                    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>While we don't discriminate based on career path, members should have experience in something that allows them to contribute a highly specific skill set to the team, such as 'spreadsheet optimization,' 'restaurant reconnaissance,' or 'powder depth paranoia'.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="requirement-card">
                    <div class="requirement-number">06</div>
                    <h3>Schedule Flexibility</h3>
                    <p>The TeamExtreme calendar is planned approximately 9-12 months in advance with the kind of precision typically reserved for multi-day corporate retreats on value creation. Members must be willing to schedule their lives around these dates, or at minimum, pretend to feel guilty when they can't.</p>

    <!-- Application Process -->

        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Application Process</h2>
            <div class="process-content">
                <p class="lead">Due to overwhelming interest (actual interest levels: moderate), TeamExtreme has established a formal application process that is both rigorous and entirely made up as we went along.</p>
                
                <div class="process-steps">
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <div class="step-number">Phase I</div>
                        <h3>Initial Inquiry</h3>
                        <p>Prospective members should submit a letter of interest explaining why they believe they possess the unique combination of skiing ability, organizational tolerance, and self-aware humor necessary for TeamExtreme membership.</p>
                        <p class="step-note">Letters should be between 500-1,000 words. We won't read anything longer, and anything shorter suggests insufficient commitment.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <div class="step-number">Phase II</div>
                        <h3>Committee Review</h3>
                        <p>Applications are reviewed by our Membership Committee, which consists of all current members sitting around after dinner making increasingly absurd comments about each application until we get tired and decide to table the discussion.</p>
                        <p class="step-note">This process typically takes 3-6 months, or until someone mentions it again.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <div class="step-number">Phase III</div>
                        <h3>Trial Period</h3>
                        <p>Should the Committee reach consensus (defined as "nobody actively objects"), candidates are invited to participate in a single trip on a provisional basis. This allows both parties to assess compatibility, skiing ability, and tolerance for extended debates about equipment choices.</p>
                        <p class="step-note">Provisional members receive all the responsibilities of full membership but none of the prestige, which admittedly is also none.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="process-step">
                        <div class="step-number">Phase IV</div>
                        <h3>Final Deliberation</h3>
                        <p>Following the trial period, the Committee convenes for what we've termed the "Final Deliberation," which sounds more dramatic than it is. Members discuss the candidate's performance, fit with group dynamics, and whether they laughed at our jokes.</p>
                        <p class="step-note">Decisions are final and non-negotiable, mostly because we forget what we decided and don't want to go through this again.</p>
